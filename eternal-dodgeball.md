# Eternal Dodgeball

Eternal dodgeball requires a large playing area and 1-3 balls. Players spread out in the playing area. One player starts with a ball.

The player with the ball can only move one of their feet. The other foot must remain stationary untill the ball is released. The player can throw the ball at another person. 

If the person thrown at is hit below the neck, they are considered out. If they catch the ball, the person who threw the ball is out. If the ball bounces before it hits anyone, no one is out. Any hit above the neck does not count. Many headshots by a single player may cause them to be pulled out of the game

When a person is 'out', they must sit down. While out, players may catch and throw balls at other players but cannot move. If they throw the ball at a player who is not out, and hit them causing them to become out, the thrower can stand up and is no longer considered out.
