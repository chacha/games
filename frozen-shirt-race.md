Frozen Shirt Race
==============

Setup
-------
Obtain a separate shirt for each team playing. Soak it in water and then place it in a freezer overnight. Meanwhile also obtain enough cups for each team playing.

Place a single red bucket full of water into the middle of the game area. Place empty buckets with a line marked in them equidistant from the center bucket.

Game Play
---------------
Gather all the teams to the center bucket and explain the game. Each team will have to break open their frozen shirt and wear the shirt in order for them to be allowed to run to the center bucket and get a cup of water. 

The goal of the game is to fill your individual bucket with water to the fill line first. All team members must participate once before anyone can go again.

The winning team is the team that fills the bucket to the line first. 

Game Play Maths
-----------------------

1 run = 20 seconds
Each action of putting on the shirt, running to the main water container, filling the cup, running back, and taking off the shirt should take this number of seconds.

Total game time  = 7 minutes
7 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 420 seconds
420 seconds / 20 seconds = 27 runs per shirt.

5 shirts * 27 runs per shirt = 135 total runs.
That means that a single team should have to fill up 135 cups worth of water to win the race.

Using Red Solo Cups, each run would transfer about 6oz of water (cups hold 8oz and we're allowing for spilling).

That means that 135 cups times 6oz = 810oz of water for a 7 minute run. That's 6.3 gallons of water.
