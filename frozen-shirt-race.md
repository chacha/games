Frozen Shirt Race
==============

Setup
-------
Obtain a separate shirt for each team playing. Soak it in water and then place it in a freezer overnight. Meanwhile also obtain enough cups for each team playing.

Place a single red bucket full of water into the middle of the game area. Place empty buckets with a line marked in them equidistant from the center bucket.

Game Play
---------------
Gather all the teams to the center bucket and explain the game. Each team will have to break open their frozen shirt and wear the shirt in order for them to be allowed to run to the center bucket and get a cup of water. 

The goal of the game is to fill your individual bucket with water to the fill line first. All team members must participate once before anyone can go again.

The winning team is the team that fills the bucket to the line first.

| Variable        | Value | Description                                   |
| ---------       | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1 full run      | 20s   | Time to make a round trip to the water bucket | 
| Game Time       | 420s  | Total game time in seconds                    |
| Runs per game   | 27    | Number of runs available in a full game       |
| Size of cup     | 8oz   | Size of cup being used                        |
| Spill allowance | 2oz   | Buffer to allow for spillage                  |
| Load per run    | 6oz   | Size of cup minus spill allowance             |
| Water transfer  | 162oz | Amount of water able to be transferred        |

1 run = 20 seconds
Each action of putting on the shirt, running to the main water container, filling the cup, running back, and taking off the shirt should take this number of seconds.

Total game time  = 7 minutes
7 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 420 seconds
420 seconds / 20 seconds = 27 runs per shirt.

Using Red Solo Cups, each run would transfer about 6oz of water (cups hold 8oz and we're allowing for spilling).

That means that 27 cups times 6oz = 162oz of water for a 7 minute run. That's 1.2 gallons of water.

If you were to time this by 5 cups, you'd get 810oz of water or 6.3 gallons of water.

Supply List
------------------------

1 goal bucket for each team  
1 filling bucket for each team  

1 t-shirt and 1 cup for each team, times the number of runners available to every team.
For instance, if each team can have 3 runners, it is 3 shirts and 3 cups per team.
