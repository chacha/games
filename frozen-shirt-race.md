Frozen Shirt Race
==============

Setup
-------
Obtain a separate shirt for each team playing. Soak it in water and then place it in a freezer overnight. Meanwhile also obtain enough cups for each team playing.

Place a single red bucket full of water into the middle of the game area. Place empty buckets with a line marked in them equidistant from the center bucket.

Game Play
---------------
The goal of the game is to fill your colored buckets to the fill line with water. You will do this by running back and forth with cups from the center buckets to your colored buckets. Your team will have 5 cups, and everyone on the team must have ran at least once anyone can run a second time.

However, there is a twist. No one on your team can start running unless they have one of your colored T-Shirts. The shirts are frozen, so you must first break them a part and then your runners must put them on before they go and fill up their cup of water.

After one team member gets the cup of water, they must take off the shirt and give it to someone else. You must have your shirt completely on before you can start running. You will have 5 shirts, so after you get the first one, you might want to start breaking open the others as well.

| Variable        | Value | Description                                   |
| ---------       | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1 full run      | 20s   | Time to make a round trip to the water bucket | 
| Game Time       | 420s  | Total game time in seconds                    |
| Runs per game   | 27    | Number of runs available in a full game       |
| Size of cup     | 8oz   | Size of cup being used                        |
| Spill allowance | 2oz   | Buffer to allow for spillage                  |
| Load per run    | 6oz   | Size of cup minus spill allowance             |
| Water transfer  | 162oz | Amount of water able to be transferred        |

1 run = 20 seconds
Each action of putting on the shirt, running to the main water container, filling the cup, running back, and taking off the shirt should take this number of seconds.

Total game time  = 7 minutes
7 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 420 seconds
420 seconds / 20 seconds = 27 runs per shirt.

Using Red Solo Cups, each run would transfer about 6oz of water (cups hold 8oz and we're allowing for spilling).

That means that 27 cups times 6oz = 162oz of water for a 7 minute run. That's 1.2 gallons of water.

If you were to time this by 5 cups, you'd get 810oz of water or 6.3 gallons of water.

Supply List
------------------------

1 goal bucket for each team  
1 filling bucket for each team  

1 t-shirt and 1 cup for each team, times the number of runners available to every team.
For instance, if each team can have 3 runners, it is 3 shirts and 3 cups per team.
