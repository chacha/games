## Setup
- A quarter
- An object for teams to grab (ball, stuffed animal, water bottle, etc.) 

## Game Play
Your goal is to be the first team to grab the object, if the quarter comes up as heads.

1. Split into two even teams. Line up both teams in two single file lines between you and the object.
2. Everyone in line will hold hands and close their eyes. Only the first person can open their eyes. 
3. Flip the coin in the air, catch it, and reveal the quarter to the first person of both teams.
4. If the quarter comes up as “heads”, the first person squeezes the next person’s hand, and so on. At the end of the 
line, the last person runs to grab the object. The team that grabs the object first wins a point for the round. 
6. If the quarter comes up as “tails”, then no one squeezes anyone’s hand. 
7. The first person goes to the back of the line and the game continues. 

The first team that reaches 10 points wins the game.
