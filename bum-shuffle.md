# Bum Shuffle

In Bum Shuffle, each player grabs a chair and places it in a large circle with less than a couple inches between each neighboring chair.

One player is selected and brought into the middle of the circle, leaving an empty seat. The player spins around three times with their eyes closed and then can try to fill the empty chair.

Neighboring players can 'shuffle' from chair to chair to prevent the person in the middle from sitting down. The players sitting down will shuffle to fill the seat, creating another empty seat. Players can only occupy one chair, and going back and forth is not allowed. 

When the player in the middle finally sits down, the player to the left or right (who didn't shuffle over fast enough) will become the new player in the middle.

#### Variations

* Yell out 'Shuffle' and everyone must get up and find a new seat. You can then either pick a new person to be in the middle, or during the switch sit down yourself, filling the empty seat and causing one person to be stuck in the middle.
* Yell 'Switch' to force the direction of the shuffle to switch. If a person just shuffled to the left, they must now shuffle to the right.
