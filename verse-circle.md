# Verse Circle

This is the perfect game is you want a group to memorize something, whether its a bible verse, song, or something else. 

## Setup

Have your verse, song, or whatever piece of text that you want people to be memorizing. You can have just one or a couple,
but you need to have it ready before the game starts. Possibly having it written up on a board is a plus.

You also should have a couple leaders with copies of the tex.t

## Play

### Learning the text
In order to play, first introduce the text to your players. If it a single piece of text, gather everyone together
and read through it a couple times. You need to get your audience familliar enough with it so they have a fighting chance.

Here are some ways you can help the group learn it:

- Write the text down on a board, and erase a couple words during each iteration, with the whole group reciting it together.
- Split into several groups and have each group try to memorize the text, and then come back together and say it as one.

### Seeing who knows it
Once you have some confidence that people know the text, join everyone together in a circle. Here are the rules:

1. One person starts by saying the first word of the text.
2. The next person says the next word.
3. This continues until someone says the wrong word. When that happens, the person leaves the circle and has to recite 
the entire verse to a leader to get back into the circle.
4. The next person starts the verse over at the beginning.
5. The game ends when the entire text has been successfully recited. 

To make the game longer or more challenging, encourage students to go faster. You can also put time limits on 
the amount of time someone can spend thinking about it.
