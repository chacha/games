Water Attack
==========

Setup
-------
Create an arena by using cars to create an enclosed area in the middle of the parking lot. This space will be used as the center for the game. Most likely this should happen nearby the skate park area of the parking lot.

In the arena place 5 full trash cans of water, all of the trash cans being loaded with random water toys (squishy balls, water balloons, etc).

Gather all leaders 5 minutes before game time, explain the rules and have them hide in/around cars.

Game Play
--------------
Bring all the kids into the center of the arena. Tell them that their counselors have left to go get Starbucks and will be back in a little bit. Divide the group by gender into two teams. Each team is told to come up with their own cheer.

About 2 minutes into coming up with a cheer, yell out the signal and have leaders rush in with water guns, buckets, etc. Giant water fight breaks out.

All leaders should know that kids that are outside of the boundaries of the arena are off limits, as this is the dry zone. One leader with the hose is essentially the guard and anyone behind them should be considered safe.
