# Streets & Alleys

Streets & Alleys is played in a large playing area.

Students line up in lines of 5. All 5 students should be about arm distance apart from the people next to them. Create several lines and place them so that students are about arm distance from both the people next to them as they are the people in front of them.

Students hold their arms up to barely touch their neighbor. When someone yells 'Switch!', students turn 90 degrees and hold their arms up with their new neighbors (the people that were infront of/behind them). This will create columns or rows in the grid.

Pick two students, one to be the 'cat' and one to be the 'mouse'. Tell the mouse they have a 5 second head start to run away before the cat chases after them. Also, both the cat and mouse cannot pass the arms of students.

The cat and mouse will run around. Every once in awhile yell 'Switch' to trap the cat and mouse in different alleys/streets and they must reorient themselves.

If the cat tags the mouse, their roles either switch or two new people are selected.
