# VBS 2014

Day 1: Capture the Flag
=============

Setup
-------
Take a large area. Define a center line. On one corner of each side of the field should be a jail that is marked with cones. Opposite of the jail should be the goal zone that is also marked with cones. In the center of the goal zone should be another cone with a ball on it. 

Divide the teams evenly into two groups. One set of players will get a set of pennies to wear, the other team will not. Teams will go to the far ends of their respective sides.

Game Play
---------------
Crossing into the other teams zone means you can be tagged. If you are tagged you must go to the **jail zone** until a team member that has not been tagged runs across and tags you. When you have been tagged in jail, you are allowed a free walk back to your side of the field.

Each side has a **goal zone**. You can be in the goal zone for a total of 10 seconds without anyone on the opposite team being allowed to enter the zone and tag you.  If you get tagged while having the ball from the goal zone, the ball gets reset to the goal zone.

You **score** by either running or tossing the ball to your side of the field. If you throw the ball, a team member must catch the ball or it does not count. If for any reason the ball is dropped, it must be reset to the goal zone. After the ball is scored, it is reset to the goal zone.

If the game leader yells **Jailbreak!**, anyone in jail is allowed a free walk back to their side.

Day 2: Frozen Shirt Race
==============

Setup
-------
Obtain a separate shirt for each team playing. Soak it in water and then place it in a freezer overnight. Meanwhile also obtain enough cups for each team playing.

Place a single red bucket full of water into the middle of the game area. Place empty buckets with a line marked in them equidistant from the center bucket.

Game Play
---------------
Gather all the teams to the center bucket and explain the game. Each team will have to break open their frozen shirt and wear the shirt in order for them to be allowed to run to the center bucket and get a cup of water. 

The goal of the game is to fill your individual bucket with water to the fill line first. All team members must participate once before anyone can go again.

The winning team is the team that fills the bucket to the line first. 

Day 3: Ahfron
=====

Setup
--------
Place four colored buckets on one end of the game area. Have all players start on the opposite end of the game area. 

Game Play
---------------
Upon entering the game area, players can tag **card tossers**. Every time a card tosser is tagged, they throw out 3-4 cards into the air. Players can grab one card at a time to bring to their colored bucket to score points.

While players are trying to grab cards **taggers** will take socks stuffed with another sock and swing it around trying to tag players. When a player is tagged, they must sit down on the ground and not move. **Medics** will go around and tap players who have been tagged. After a tagged player has been tapped they may continue to move.

Scoring
----------
Every card get one point. The team with the most cards in their bucket at the end of the game wins.

Day 5: Water Attack
==========

Setup
-------
Create an arena by using cars to create an enclosed area in the middle of the parking lot. This space will be used as the center for the game. Most likely this should happen nearby the skate park area of the parking lot.

In the arena place 5 full trash cans of water, all of the trash cans being loaded with random water toys (squishy balls, water balloons, etc).

Gather all leaders 5 minutes before game time, explain the rules and have them hide in/around cars.

Game Play
--------------
Bring all the kids into the middle of the arena and divide them by gender into two teams. Each team is told to come up with their own cheer.

About 2 minutes into coming up with a cheer, yell out the signal and have leaders rush in with water guns, buckets, etc. Giant water fight breaks out.

All leaders should know that kids that are outside of the boundaries of the arena are off limits, as this is the dry zone. One leader with the hose is essentially the guard and anyone behind them should be considered safe.
