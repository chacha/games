Wolf Tag
=====

Setup
--------
Set aside a space in the middle of the playing area as the safe zone. 

Game Play
---------------
Select a wolf. That wolf will go and hide in the playing area while the sheep either close their eyes or are moved to an area where they cannot see where the wolf hides. Once the wolf has hidden, the sheep go and search for the wolf. When a sheep finds the wolf, they yell out "Wolf!" and all of the sheep attempt to make it back to the safe zone.

While the sheep run to the safe zone, the wolf is able to tag sheep. If a sheep is tagged, they are out until the next round. A new wolf is chosen from the sheep that have made it back to the safe zone.
