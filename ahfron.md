Ahfron
=====

Setup
--------
Place four colored buckets on one end of the game area. Have all players start on the opposite end of the game area. 

Game Play
---------------
The goal of the game is to get as many cards as possible into your bucket. You can get cards to tagging a **card tosser** wearing a funny hat. Whenever you tag the card tosser, they will throw cards into the air. You can pick up only one card at a time and bring it back to your colored bucket.

However, while you are trying to do this some leaders will be running around with **ahfrons**. If you get hit by the spinning ahfron, you must sit down where you were tagged.

When you are tagged, the only way to become untagged is for a **medic** to tap you with one of the pool noodles. As soon as you are tapped, you can get up and continue your journey to get the card into the bucket. 

Whoever gets the most cards into their bucket wins the game.
