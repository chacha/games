Setup
--------
Place four colored buckets on one end of the game area. Have all players start on the opposite end of the game area. 

Game Play
---------------
Upon entering the game area, players can tag **card tossers**. Every time a card tosser is tagged, they throw out 3-4 cards into the air. Players can grab one card at a time to bring to their colored bucket to score points.

While players are trying to grab cards **taggers** will take socks stuffed with another sock and swing it around trying to tag players. When a player is tagged, they must sit down on the ground and not move. **Medics** will go around and tap players who have been tagged. After a tagged player has been tapped they may continue to move.

Scoring
----------
Every card get one point. The team with the most cards in their bucket at the end of the game wins.
