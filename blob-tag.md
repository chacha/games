Blob Tag
=========


Game Play
--------------
Select two students and have them link arms. Those two students will form a 'blob'. If the 'blob' tags anyone using their outside (free) arms, that student will join the end of the blob. The blob cannot tag people if it is not linked together. The goal of the game is for the blob to tag all students.
