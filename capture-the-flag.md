Capture the Flag
=============

Setup
-------
Take a large area. Define a center line. On one corner of each side of the field should be a jail that is marked with cones. Opposite of the jail should be the goal zone that is also marked with cones. In the center of the goal zone should be another cone with a ball on it. 

Divide the teams evenly into two groups. One set of players will get a set of pennies to wear, the other team will not. Teams will go to the far ends of their respective sides.

Game Play
---------------
Crossing into the other teams zone means you can be tagged. If you are tagged you must go to the **jail zone** until a team member that has not been tagged runs across and tags you. When you have been tagged in jail, you are allowed a free walk back to your side of the field.

Each side has a **goal zone**. You can be in the goal zone for a total of 10 seconds without anyone on the opposite team being allowed to enter the zone and tag you.  If you get tagged while having the ball from the goal zone, the ball gets reset to the goal zone.

You **score** by either running or tossing the ball to your side of the field. If you throw the ball, a team member must catch the ball or it does not count. If for any reason the ball is dropped, it must be reset to the goal zone. After the ball is scored, it is reset to the goal zone.

If the game leader yells **Jailbreak!**, anyone in jail is allowed a free walk back to their side.
