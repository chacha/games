Capture the Flag
=============

Setup
-------
Take a large area. Define a center line. On one corner of each side of the field should be a jail that is marked with cones. Opposite of the jail should be the goal zone that is also marked with cones. In the center of the goal zone should be another cone with a ball on it. 

Divide the teams evenly into two groups. One set of players will get a set of pennies to wear, the other team will not. Teams will go to the far ends of their respective sides.

Game Play
---------------
In this game, the field is divided up into two sides. Your goal is to bring the other team's ball back to your side. 

When you cross over onto the other side of the field, you can be tagged by any member of the other team. If you are tagged, you must go directly to their **jail zone**. When you are in jail, a team member can run and tag you and both of you get a free walk back to your side of the field. If the game leader yells **Jailbreak!**, anyone in jail is allowed a free walk back to their side.

The ball is located in the **goal zone**. When you run into the goal zone, people from the opposite team cannot tag you for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, you must leave the goal zone or your opponents can run in and tag you. 

When you have the ball, if you get tagged the ball must be reset back to the goal zone before anyone else can grab it. If you throw the ball to try to make it to your side, one of your team mates must catch it for it to count. If they drop it, it must be put back in the goal zone.

After a ball is scored, the ball is put back in the goal zone.
